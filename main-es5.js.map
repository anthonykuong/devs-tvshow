The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds.

She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia.

In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, arrest Lily for causing the crash, and take her away for <a href=\"/wiki/Involuntary_commitment\" title=\"Involuntary commitment\">psychiatric commitment</a>, while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.</td></tr>\n  <tr class=\"vevent\" style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep5\" style=\"text-align:center\">5</th><td class=\"summary\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Episode 5\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Alex Garland</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Alex Garland</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">March&#160;26,&#160;2020<span style=\"display:none\">&#160;(<span class=\"bday dtstart published updated\">2020-03-26</span>)</span></td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #515C47\">\n    Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing <a href=\"/wiki/Go_(game)\" title=\"Go (game)\">Go</a> with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting and first admission of love for each other, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.</td></tr>\n  <tr class=\"vevent\" style=\"text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2\"><th scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" id=\"ep6\" style=\"text-align:center\">6</th><td class=\"summary\" style=\"text-align:left\">\"Episode 6\"</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Alex Garland</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Alex Garland</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">April&#160;2,&#160;2020<span style=\"display:none\">&#160;(<span class=\"bday dtstart published updated\">2020-04-02</span>)</span></td></tr><tr class=\"expand-child\"><td class=\"description\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 3px #515C47\">\n    Lyndon breaks into Stewart's <a href=\"/wiki/Motorhome\" title=\"Motorhome\">RV</a> and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project.

However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause.

However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life.

He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in a simulation inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, an emotional Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on.

The pilot was written by Alex Garland\n        who also directed and executive produced the episode as well.\n        On July 23, 2018, Rob Hardy mentioned in an interview that he\n        would serve as the cinematographer for the series\n        On August 3, 2018, it was announced during the Television Critics\n        Association's annual summer press tour that FX had decided\n        o bypass the pilot process and instead were giving the production\n        a straight-to-series order consisting of eight episodes.\n        Additional executive producers include Andrew Macdonald,\n        Allon Reich, Eli Bush, and Scott Rudin.\n        Garland appeared at the New York Comic Con and explained his\n        reasoning behind the creation of the series:\n        \"I read more about science than anything else, and it started\n        with two things. One was getting my head around this principle\n        of determinism, which basically says that everything that happens\n        in the world is based on cause and effect...\n        That has all sorts of implications for us. One is that it takes\n        away free will, but the other is that if you are at a computer\n        powerful enough, you could use determinism to predict the future\n        and understand the past. If you unravel everything about you,\n        about the specifics of you why you prefer a cup of coffee to tea...\n        then five seconds before you said you'd like to have a cup of\n        coffee one would be able to predict you'd ask for it.\"\n        In November 2019, it was announced the show would premiere on Hulu\n        instead of FX, as part of \"FX on Hulu\".On January 9, 2020,\n        it was announced that the series would premiere on March 5, 2020.</p>\n\n</div>\n","// This file can be replaced during build by using the `fileReplacements` array.\n// `ng build --prod` replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts`.\n// The list of file replacements can be found in `angular.json`.\n\nexport const environment = {\n  production: false\n};\n\n/*\n * For easier debugging in development mode, you can import the following file\n * to ignore zone related error stack frames such as `zone.run`, `zoneDelegate.invokeTask`.\n *\n * This import should be commented out in production mode because it will have a negative impact\n * on performance if an error is thrown.\n */\n// import 'zone.js/dist/zone-error';  // Included with Angular CLI.\n","import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\n\nimport { AppModule } from './app/app.module';\nimport { environment } from './environments/environment';\n\nif (environment.production) {\n  enableProdMode();\n}\n\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\n"]}
