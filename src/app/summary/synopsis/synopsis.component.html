  <h2>More Details</h2>
  <p>
        On March 13, 2018, it was announced that FX had given the
        production a pilot order. The pilot was written by Alex Garland
        who also directed and executive produced the episode as well.
        On July 23, 2018, Rob Hardy mentioned in an interview that he
        would serve as the cinematographer for the series
        On August 3, 2018, it was announced during the Television Critics
        Association's annual summer press tour that FX had decided
        o bypass the pilot process and instead were giving the production
        a straight-to-series order consisting of eight episodes.
        Additional executive producers include Andrew Macdonald,
        Allon Reich, Eli Bush, and Scott Rudin.
        Garland appeared at the New York Comic Con and explained his
        reasoning behind the creation of the series:
        "I read more about science than anything else, and it started
        with two things. One was getting my head around this principle
        of determinism, which basically says that everything that happens
        in the world is based on cause and effect...
        That has all sorts of implications for us. One is that it takes
        away free will, but the other is that if you are at a computer
        powerful enough, you could use determinism to predict the future
        and understand the past. If you unravel everything about you,
        about the specifics of you why you prefer a cup of coffee to tea...
        then five seconds before you said you'd like to have a cup of
        coffee one would be able to predict you'd ask for it."
        In November 2019, it was announced the show would premiere on Hulu
        instead of FX, as part of "FX on Hulu".On January 9, 2020,
        it was announced that the series would premiere on March 5, 2020.</p>
