    Sergei, an employee of the tech company Amaya, is offered a position on Amaya's secretive quantum computing 'Devs' team by Forest, the <a href="/wiki/CEO" class="mw-redirect" title="CEO">CEO</a>. Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a <a href="/wiki/Faraday_cage" title="Faraday cage">Faraday cage</a> by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from <a href="/wiki/Cloud_storage" title="Cloud storage">the cloud</a> and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as <a href="/wiki/Sudoku" title="Sudoku">Sudoku</a>, a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

    Forest attempts to console Lily and tells her about the death of his own young daughter, Amaya, and his difficulty in dealing with a reality he considers impossible. Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a <a href="/wiki/Russian_government" class="mw-redirect" title="Russian government">Russian government</a> messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia. Anton derides him over Amaya's secrecy and attacks Kenton, stabbing him, and in the ensuing struggle Kenton breaks Anton's neck.</td></tr>

    Senator Laine, who wants to use the Devs technology for the US government, visits Amaya and questions Forest about his work. Katie admonishes the Devs team for using the projection system for their own amusement, with Stewart scorning her hypocracy. Lily shares her suspicions with co-workers that Sergei was murdered, and they advise her to tell Kenton. Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator. When Kenton goes out after her, Jen copies data from his computer onto a flash drive — Lily, with Jen's help, had feigned schizophrenia to get the security camera footage from the night of Sergei's death. Lily watches the footage with Jamie, who notices that the flames on the screen are not real, but <a href="/wiki/Visual_effects" title="Visual effects">digital effects</a>.

    Watching projections of the future, Forest reveals to Katie that Lily will die in two days. Lily and Jamie argue over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where Pete, the homeless man who lives there, treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the <a href="/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" title="Many-worlds interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a>, rather than the <a href="/wiki/Deterministic_system" title="Deterministic system">deterministic</a> <a href="/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory" title="De Broglie–Bohm theory">De Broglie–Bohm theory</a> favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, arrest Lily for causing the crash, and take her away for <a href="/wiki/Involuntary_commitment" title="Involuntary commitment">psychiatric commitment</a>, while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.</td></tr>

    Lyndon breaks into Stewart's <a href="/wiki/Motorhome" title="Motorhome">RV</a> and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project. Lily awakes in the <a href="/wiki/Napa_County,_California" title="Napa County, California">Napa</a> motel James brought her to, and after realizing they cannot run, decides to go back to San Francisco instead to confront Forest at his house. They find him there with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system – a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them. Lily decides to go back home, and invites Jamie to sleep in her bed, where they kiss.</td></tr>

    Lyndon seeks to regain his position at the now-fully-operational Devs by talking to Katie. She tells him he can re-join the project if he proves his faith in the many-worlds interpretation by standing at a perilous height overlooking a <a href="/wiki/Dam" title="Dam">dam</a>, proposing that he will only be conscious of the worlds in which he does not fall to his death. He adheres to this vision, but falls and dies in the present world. Lily and Jamie resume their relationship, and she tells him she plans on proving the Devs team is delusional by not showing up when the machine predicts she will. However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life. Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US. Instead, Lily heads to Devs.</td></tr>

    Inside the Devs labs, Forest shows Lily a projection of what she is about to do: holding Kenton's gun on Forest, she leads him into the transportation capsule leading out of Devs and shoots him, causing the capsule to crash and killing Lily in the fall. Beyond this point, Devs can see nothing. Forest tells Lily that their actions have been predetermined and that the system's real name is <i><a href="/wiki/Deus" title="Deus">Deus</a></i>. Lily leads Forest into the capsule as projected, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_suspension" title="Electromagnetic suspension">electromagnetic field</a> that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die. Before he walks away, Stewart tells a devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in a simulation inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, an emotional Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on. Inside Devs, Lily finds Jamie and hugs him, which he returns.</td></tr></tbody></table>
